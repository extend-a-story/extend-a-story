So you want to play the game? That is certainly possible. The game is not
complicated, and it's not really neccesary to read these instructions, but
they do clue you into the basics of what's going on. Once you feel
comfortable with the basics, you can move on to
<a href="create.html">creating</a> some episodes of your own. Once you've
got that, go try out some of the <a href="advanced.html">advanced</a>
features.

  <h3>What is it?</h3>
</div>

<p>
Extend-A-Story is like a choose your own adventure game, with a twist.
Conventional choose your own adventure games are written by one person,
with a definite central plot, a starting point and several stop points.
</p>

<p>
Extend-A-Story is not written by one person. It is more of a shared story,
written by several people - the other players of the game. There is one
starting point, but from there the story diverges according to the desires
of the players writing it. Eventually you will reach a portion of the
story that has not been created yet. At that point, you can continue the
story with your own episode for others to enjoy.
</p>

<div class="centered">
  <h3>How to Play</h3>
</div>

<p>
You start the story off in episode 1. Each episode is a point in the story
that describes what is happening and presents the reader with some
options. An episode doesn't neccessarily represent a location in the
story, but could describe some event. Every episode is numbered. The
episode number and it's title are always present at the top of every story
page.
</p>

<p>
The text description is a narrative explaining what is happening, or what
just happened in the story. The options following the narrative are links
to other episodes. You select which path you want to follow by selecting
one of the options. One choice may be to add your own option. This is an
<a href="advanced.html">advanced</a> feature, and can be ignored.
Sometimes an option will lead to an episode that hasn't been created yet.
</p>

<p>
Every episode will permit you to go back to the previous episode. Some
episodes will have the author's signature on them. Every episode lists the
date and time it was created. Some episodes will have <i>linking</i> or
<i>extending</i> enabled. Those are both
<a href="advanced.html">advanced</a> features, and can be ignored.
