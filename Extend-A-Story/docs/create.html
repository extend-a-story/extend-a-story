So you've played the game for a while and understand what is going on.
You've probably run into a few episodes that haven't been created yet and
want to know how you can participate by creating your own episodes as
additions to the story. This help file is for you.
</p>

<div class="centered">
  <h3>First Steps of Creation</h3>
</div>

<p>
When you finally navigate to an episode that has not been created yet, you
will be told one of two things:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The episode is locked while someone else is working on it.</li>
  <li>The episode is not created, and you can create it if you wish.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the episode is locked, that means that another player is currently
creating that episode. You will need to wait for them to finish the
episode before you can read it. Some players lock an episode for creating
it, but then forget to finish the episode. These are considered abandoned
episodes. You will be told when an episode is abandoned, and you will be
allowed to unlock it so that you can create it yourself.
</p>

<p>
If you decide to create the episode, click on the link that reads
<b>Create this episode!</b> If you don't want to create the episode, and
would rather get back to reading the story, click on the link that reads
<b>Cancel</b>.
</p>

<div class="centered">
  <h3>Entering the Scenario</h3>
</div>

<p>
First you must enter a title for the episode. Then in the large text box
you enter the description of what action is taking place. You may enter as
much as you want, the box will scroll vertically to accomodate you. Do not
try to format the text, as most spacing will be ignored. However, a subset
of HTML tags can be used to format the text. The currently allowed tags
are:<br />
&lt;P&gt;, &lt;/P&gt;, &lt;BR&gt;, &lt;HR&gt;
&lt;B&gt;, &lt;/B&gt;, &lt;I&gt;, &lt;/I&gt;
</p>

<p>
Now you must enter in the options the reader will be able to take at the
end of the episode. The number of options available will vary from story
to story. You don't have to use all of them! Simply describe as many
options as you want the reader to have and leave the rest blank. You must
describe at least one option. The second column of text fields labeled
<b>Back Linked Episode</b> is part of an
<a href="advanced.html">advanced</a>
feature and can be ignored. There are a handful of HTML tags you can use
when describing the options. The currently allowed tags are:<br />
&lt;B&gt;, &lt;/B&gt;, &lt;I&gt;, &lt;/I&gt;
</p>

<p>
Now you may select a color scheme for the episode. This defaults to the
scheme of the parent episode. You may pick a new one, if you feel your
episode requires a different look.
</p>

<p>
If you wish, you may sign the episode. Feel free to include your real
name, or an alias. This should be used as a method for people to identify
other episodes you've created.
</p>

<p>
The remaining items are <a href="advanced.html">advanced</a> features, and
can be ignored.
</p>

<div class="centered">
  <h3>Previewing Your Episode</h3>
</div>

<p>
When you are satisfied with what you have written, select the
<b>Preview</b> button near the bottom of the page. This will bring you
back to the same page, but this time there will be a new section
displaying a preview of your episode almost exactly as it will appear when
saved. (Please note that your chosen color scheme will not be part of this
preview.)
</p>

<p>
Take the time to review your episode and verify that it looks as you
intended it to look. If you need to make changes, make the appropriate
changes and then select the <b>Preview</b> button again to see how your
changes look.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the preview section is the <b>Save</b> button. If any
problems were detected with your episode, the <b>Save</b> button will
instead be replaced by a list of problems you need to correct in your
episode before you can save. Simply correct those problems and select the
<b>Preview</b> button again to bring up the save button.
</p>

<p>
If at any point you decide you no longer want to create the episode you
are working on, select the <b>Cancel</b> button at the bottom of the page.
This will unlock the episode and permit another player to create it if
they so choose.
</p>

<div class="centered">
  <h3>Final Steps of Creation</h3>
</div>

<p>
When you are completely satisfied with how your episode looks, select the
<b>Save</b> button. This will write your episode to the database and allow
all of the other players to read it. You will be presented with a page
indicating that your episode was successfully saved, and you will be
provided a link to enter the newly created episode.
</p>

<p>
In the unlikely event that you find problems with your episode after you
have saved it, you will have the option to edit it (if you have cookies
enabled in your browser). To edit an episode you have already created,
simple click the <b>Edit</b> link located at the bottom of the episode.
